# React Spatial

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/geops/react-spatial.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This library provides React components to build web applications based on [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/).

## Getting Started

Install the [`react-spatial` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spatial):

```
yarn add ol react-spatial
```

Import components you need for your application:

```js
import BasicMap from 'react-spatial/components/map/BasicMap'

<BasicMap map={this.map} layers={[this.layers]} />
```

Your build pipeline needs to support ES6 modules and SASS.
